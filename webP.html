	<br>
	What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a method of data analysis. It automates the building of statistical model.

<br> Machine Learing can provide human many benefits:
<OL Type = "1" start = "1">
<li> It saves time</li>
<li> It helps find hidden information</li>	
<li> It can be used in different industries</li>

	Machine Learning includes many methods. Some of them are advanced algorithms, and some of them are traditional algorithms.<br>Today, I want to explain some popular algorithms:
