	<br>
	What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a method of data analysis. It automates the building of statistical model.

<br> Machine Learing can provide human many benefits:
<OL Type = "1" start = "1">
<li> It saves time</li>
<li> It helps find hidden information</li>	
<li> It can be used in different industries</li>

	Machine Learning includes many methods. Some of them are advanced algorithms, and some of them are traditional algorithms.<br>Today, I want to explain some popular algorithms:

		<Marquee align = top loop = infinite height = 200 width = 500 scrollamount = 3 Scrolldelay = 150 direction = up vspace = 100 hspace = 100 behavior = scroll> 1950 — Alan Turing creates the “Turing Test” to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, a computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human.</Marquee>

			1952 — Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer learning program. The program was the game of checkers, and the IBM IBM -0.15% computer improved at the game the more it played, studying which moves made up winning strategies and incorporating those moves into its program

		1981 — Gerald Dejong introduces the concept of Explanation Based Learning (EBL), in which a computer analyses training data and creates a general rule it can follow by discarding unimportant data.

		2006 — Geoffrey Hinton coins the term “deep learning” to explain new algorithms that let computers “see” and distinguish objects and text in images and videos

		2016 – Google’s artificial intelligence algorithm beats a professional player at the Chinese board game Go, which is considered the world’s most complex board game and is many times harder than chess. The AlphaGo algorithm developed by Google DeepMind managed to win five games out of five in the Go competition.
